                           The Monkees Music webpage
Social media and music platform.
My project is to attract new listeners to the monkees music providing a introduction
to who they are.

It also provides previously unheard Music and things of interest to help attract
patreons who are already aware of the band.

It is a platform to help encourage transfer of interest into further social media 
accounts and to book live preformances.




                                  UX
This project is built for both existing monkees fans and potiental new fans,

Its main goal for both  is to recieve a quick concise introduction to the monkees
music and background of the band .
This should be simple and user friendly as the potiental age group can be older so
may have difficulites with overcomplicated Ui.

                                    Bugs
The main bug found is the div element listed with the band members.
On the lower resoluation and pixel count the element does break into a verticle display
but is at a much smaller resolution.
Bug may be fixed with further use of bootstrap or javascript.
